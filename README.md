# Musical texture via VAE

Ongoing experiment to generate 2D graphic representations for various musical gestures via a variational autoencoder. The repo includes the VAE code based on https://github.com/iechevarria/lego-face-VAE and code to translate the resultant lines into (quasi-)conventional musical notation.
